# FARM-DOCTOR

## description- 
hey there!! this is FARM DOCTOR a web-based platform designed to help farmers and researchers monitor crop health using real-time satellite data. Our system integrates Sentinel-2 imagery and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) analysis to visualize the health of crops in an easy and interactive way.

The main goal is to make satellite-driven insights accessible for every farmer â€” even in remote areas. By analyzing vegetation patterns, FARM DOCTOR can detect early signs of stress, water shortage, or disease before they become visible on the ground. The project also provides interactive map layers where users can zoom in on their own farms and check the health status in near real-time.

This tool was built with the idea of connecting space technology to ground-level agriculture. It reflects our belief that remote sensing data, when simplified through good design and AI-assisted analytics, can empower small-scale farmers to make better, faster decisions for sustainable farming.
